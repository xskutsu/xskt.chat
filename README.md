# xskt.chat

A "bring your own token" chat interface for LLMs.

# Features

Nothing particular, yet. ðŸ˜‰

# Getting Started

## Requirements

To get started, you'll probably need:

- `Node.js` v22 or later.
- `PnPM` v10.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xskutsu/xskt.chat.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory

```bash
cd xskt.chat
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. (optional) Create a .env file and specify a port

```env
PORT=3001
```

5. Start the server

```bash
pnpm start
```

The xskt.chat http server should be up and running!

## Usage

If the server is running, the web interface should be accessible at `http://localhost:3001/` in your web browser. Port 3001 by default.

# Credits

xskt.chat is heavily inspired by [t3.chat](https://t3.chat/), but does not use any of its code or assets.

xskt.chat may become obsolete if t3.chat ever offers a free "bring your own token" feature.
